## DAISM-DNN
We propose data augmentation throughin silicomixing with deep neural networks (DAISM-DNN) to achieve highly accurate andunbiased  immune-cell  proportion  estimation  from  bulk  RNA  sequencing  (RNA-seq)  data. Our method tackles the batch effect problem by creating a data-specific training dataset froma small subset of samples with ground truth cell proportions which is further augmentedwith  publicly  available  RNA-seq  data  from  purified  cells  or  single-cell  RNA-seq  (scRNA-seq) data.
A pre-print describing the method is available at Biorxiv:
